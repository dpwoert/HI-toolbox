	description: 'Social activities help strengthen bonds in a team, however executing these plans can be tedious and frustrating. With the help of this simple tool a team can easily find a fun social activity for the next team event. To create the tool each team member writes down an activity on a post-it and adds it to the Spin the Pencil template. When itâ€™s time to pick a new activity to do together simply spin a pencil in the middle of the template and see what activity the pencil nib lands on. This simple idea takes away the decision making and makes team bonding easier to plan',
